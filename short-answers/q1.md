# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

Recursive functions are very similar to loops in that you can iterate through objects or arrays with the need of calling for a for loop. 

Best cases for using recursive functions are for objects that that maybe have a property that you need but is bury deep within said object.

You mentioned that recursive functions are similar to loops because they can iterate through objects or arrays. This is a good start, but it's important to also explain that recursive functions call themselves to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This self-calling nature is what distinguishes them from loops.

Additionally, comparing recursion to loops can be a bit confusing without the right context. Recursive functions use something called a "call stack" where each function call is placed on top of the previous one, which is quite different from how loops work. It’s important to discuss the "base case" — the condition under which the recursive calls stop — and the "recursive case" — the part of the function that makes the recursive call.

Lastly, you mentioned that recursion is useful for dealing with nested objects, which is a great example. However, it would be even more helpful to show a specific example of how a recursive function can be used to find a deeply nested property in an object.
