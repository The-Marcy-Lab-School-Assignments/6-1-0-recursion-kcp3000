# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer

Recursive functions are very similar to loops in that you can iterate through objects or arrays with the need of calling for a for loop. 

Best cases for using recursive functions are for objects that that maybe have a property that you need but is bury deep within said object.
