# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

<!-- Recursion is best used when you don't know the amount of something (a number, word, things...) and needs to be called for. -->

Best used for nest objects.

# Teacher Feedback
You mentioned that recursion is "best used for nested objects." This is somewhat correct because recursion is indeed great for dealing with problems where you have to explore or manipulate data in nested structures, like file systems or complex data formats (like JSON). However, your explanation doesn't detail how recursion works in these scenarios or why it's particularly effective. 

Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This is particularly useful when the problem has a repetitive structure but is too complex to solve in one go, such as a nested object.

To make this answer more complete, it would be helpful to include an example of a recursive function in action, such as how it can navigate through nested folders or find a specific item in a deeply nested list.
