# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer

<!-- Recursion is best used when you don't know the amount of something (a number, word, things...) and needs to be called for. -->

Best used for nested objects.

Not only nested objects but recursion is also great for traversing through big blocks of data (like a tree). Since recursion works where it repeats itself a multitude of times until the base case is met, when looking for a specific data, recursion can do exactly that.

# Teacher Feedback
~~You mentioned that recursion is "best used for nested objects." This is somewhat correct because recursion is indeed great for dealing with problems where you have to explore or manipulate data in nested structures, like file systems or complex data formats (like JSON). However, your explanation doesn't detail how recursion works in these scenarios or why it's particularly effective. ~~

~~Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to break down a problem into smaller, more manageable parts. This is particularly useful when the problem has a repetitive structure but is too complex to solve in one go, such as a nested object.~~

~~To make this answer more complete, it would be helpful to include an example of a recursive function in action, such as how it can navigate through nested folders or find a specific item in a deeply nested list. ~~

You got it!
