# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer


Elegant and concise code, solving problems that could be divided into similar sub problems

Drawback is probably memory usage(?). Another one being the risk of stack overflow.

# Teacher Feedback
You correctly identified potential drawbacks of using recursive functions, such as increased memory usage and the risk of stack overflow. It would be beneficial to explain a bit more about what stack overflow isâ€”essentially, it's what happens when there are too many function calls and the program runs out of space in the call stack.

Additionally, adding examples to illustrate both benefits and drawbacks would greatly enhance your explanation. For example, you could show a simple recursive function, like one that computes factorials or traverses a file system, to demonstrate both the elegance of the solution and how quickly the stack can grow.
